Great Link explaining dependency inversion with a simple example.

1. Let's say we have a calculator class which has operation add and operation subtract.
2. Let's say tomorrow one more requirement comes to do multiply operation.
3. But Classes should be closed for modification.
4. So what should be a better class design for this architecture.

There should be a ICalculatorOperation interface which should have a method Calculate in it.

1. The calculator class and
2. All the seperate operation class should implement that interface.
3. Create an object of the ICalculatorOperation class inside the Calculator class.
4. All the individual operation classes should implement the calculate method.
5. Calculate class should also implement calculator method.
6. It should inside it call calculatoroperation.calculate.
7. At the run time pass the right calculator method.
