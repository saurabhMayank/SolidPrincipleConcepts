Dependency Injection
"""

"""
Lets first understand in very simple terms what is dependency Injection

=> You are making a sandwich -> U need bread, cheese, ham
=> Your core job is to make the sandwich -> But you need the depedencies bread, cheese, ham -> To make the sandwich

IF USING DEPENDENCY INJECTION CONCEPT
=> One way is to get these depedencies from a 3rd party
Lets do you do bigbasket -> And the guy delivers you the depdencies

i) You can now solely focus on making the sandwich
ii) You are solely focussed on preparing for the sandwich 
-> Setting the sandwich maker, getting the sauces & veggies ready
iii) When the big basket guy comes with depdencies of bread, ham and cheese 
-> You inject those dependencies -> In your sandwich

IF NOT USING DEPENDENCY INJECTION CONCEPT
=> Then I have to myself take care of getting bread, ham and cheese
